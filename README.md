# js-imc-multiplicationtable-findrepeatsword

Description
This code performs several calculations and operations. It includes calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI), generating a multiplication table, and finding repeated letters in a word.

Body Mass Index Calculation
The code includes a BMI calculation using the given weight and height values. It uses the formula BMI = weight / (height * height). The calculated BMI is then compared to predefined ranges to determine the corresponding weight category.

Multiplication Table
The code generates a multiplication table for a specified number (4 in this case). It iterates from 0 to 10 and calculates the product of the specified number and the current iteration value.

Finding Repeated Letters
The code finds the repeated letters in a given word. It converts the word to lowercase and removes any spaces. Then, it creates an object called letters to store the count of each letter. It iterates through each letter in the word and increments the count in the letters object accordingly.

Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Set the desired values for peso (weight) and altura (height) constants in the BMI calculation section.
Uncomment the desired BMI calculation method (switch or imc) and comment out the other.
If using the imc method, modify the conditions and messages based on your desired weight categories.
To generate a multiplication table, set the multiplicar constant to the desired number.
Run the code and view the output in the console.
Note: This code is written in JavaScript. Make sure you have a JavaScript runtime environment to execute it.

Feel free to modify the code as needed for your specific requirements.
